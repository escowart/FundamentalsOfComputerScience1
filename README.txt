The other files within this repository are DrRacket source files that can be run within the DrRacket IDE. The files are projects and home works I did with partners for the class above. Some of these projects however were no assigned but I wrote in my spare time.

hw# files are the specific homework files.

fibgen: Generates a Fibonacci Curve.

hangman: Allows two players to play a game of hangman. The first player types in the word and presses enter and the second play guesses the word.

koch snowflake: Generates a Koch snowflake that iterates through the snowflakes when the up arrow key is pressed.

snake: Allows A single player to play the game snake by using the arrow keys. If the player hits the wall with their character, they lose.

tetris: Allows A single player to play Tetris.
